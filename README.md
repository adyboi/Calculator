# Calculator
I've used visual studio code using python django, and I also used css framework to make my calculator creative and javascript to activate my calculator.
First step we need to do is to install python, second is install Apache and mod_wsgi, then get your database running, install the Django Code, installing an official release with pip, installing a distribution-specific package, and installing the development version, and thats it.
